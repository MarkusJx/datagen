# Introduction

datagen is a tool to generate data for testing purposes. It can be used to generate
data for unit tests, integration tests, or any other kind of test that requires data.

It uses a JSON schema to define the data to generate. The schema is a JSON object
that defines the structure of the data to generate. It can be as simple as a single
string or as complex as a nested object with multiple properties.

Check out the [generators](generators.md) section to see all the available generators.
