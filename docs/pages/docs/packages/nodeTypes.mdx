# @datagen/types

The `@datagen/types` package provides TypeScript types for the `@datagen/node` package.
This package includes a TypeScript JSON schema definition as well as the JSON schema
itself. Additionally, types for [creating node.js plugins](../plugins/node/create) are included.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @datagen/types
```

## Provided Types

### JSON Schema

The JSON schema is provided as a TypeScript type and as a JSON file. The JSON schema file
can be imported using

```ts
import { SchemaJson } from '@datagen/types';
```

The base TypeScript definition for the JSON schema is generated by
[`json-schema-to-typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-to-typescript)
and can be imported using

```ts
import { Schema } from '@datagen/types';
```

### Node.js Plugin Types

The types for creating node.js plugins are also provided by this package. These types
can be used to create plugins that can be used with the `@datagen/node` package.
The main plugin type is `DatagenPlugin{:ts}` and can be imported using

```ts
import { DatagenPlugin } from '@datagen/types';
```

Check out the [node.js plugin documentation](../plugins/node/create) for more information
on creating node.js plugins.
