# include

The `include` generator includes another schema file and uses it as a
generator. This is useful for reusing common schema definitions across
multiple files.

The generator takes the following arguments:

- `path`: The path to the schema file to include. This can be either
  absolute or relative to the current working directory.

## Example

```json filename="schema.json"
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "include",
      "path": "common/name.json"
    },
    "age": {
      "type": "include",
      "path": "common/age.json"
    }
  }
}
```

```json filename="common/name.json"
{
  "type": "string",
  "generator": {
    "type": "fullName"
  }
}
```

```json filename="common/age.json"
{
  "type": "number",
  "generator": {
    "type": "number",
    "min": 18,
    "max": 100
  }
}
```
