# Node.js plugins

`datagen` can be extended with plugins written in Node.js. These plugins are
installed as npm packages and can be used to extend the functionality of the
tool.

These plugins can only be used with the Node.js version of `datagen`. See the
[main documentation](https://github.com/MarkusJx/datagen/blob/main/README.md)
for more information.

Check the [create a node.js plugin](node/create.md) page for more information on how
to create a plugin.
