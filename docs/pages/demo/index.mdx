# Demo

This demo shows how to use `datagen` to generate data. The left editor can
be used to edit the schema, the right editor will show the generated data.

Use the `Generate` button to generate data. The generated date will be
refreshed every time the `Generate`button is pressed. Check the `Refresh automatically`
checkbox to automatically generate data when the schema changes and is a valid
JSON object.

This demo is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), the
[Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) and `datagen` compiled into a
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) module using [rustwasm](https://rustwasm.github.io/).
Plugins are not supported in this demo, as shared libraries cannot be loaded in the browser.
The demo runs inside a web worker, so the main thread is not blocked while generating data.
The generation progress is shown by the progress bar when generating large amounts of data.
Please note as the data will be generated locally, the browser may freeze when generating
large amounts of data.
